## Pantry Pals
Our project, Pantry Pals, is developing a web app to help home cooks reduce food waste and save money by offering AI powered recipe suggestions based on whatâ€™s already in your fridge.

## Technologies Used
### MongoDB
For our project, we decided to utilize `MongoDB` as our backend server due to its simplicity and easy integreation. The reason we needed a server in the first place is to store and call data into our application, creating a seamless interaction. 
### Spoonacular API
`Spoonacular` is a crucial API that was adopted into our project due to how vital is was in calling and displaying recipes. Furthermore, Spoonacular also has the ability to let users filter dishes by ingredients, diets, difficulty, and even nationally. The Spoonacular
API was implemented onto our backend.
### Walmart API
We leveraged the `Walmart API` to collect infomration about how much ingredients cost. This helps users better visualize how much their meal will cost. This API was integrated in our backend system


## Usage
### Node.js
Our program uses `Node.js` to transfer users between pages while also injecting ejs format files on the page. To properly run
the program, you must first enter "npm i" to install all requires. Then finally enter "node index.js" into the console
to finish setting up the project. 

## AI Utilization
No AI tools such as ChatGPT or Copilot was used in our application.
